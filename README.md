# UK_Labour_Market-
Project Overview:-
A UK recruitment agency is struggling to define clear strategies at the start of each month, leading to misalignment across teams and operational inefficiency. The company wishes to implement a solution that enables it to identify emerging labour market trends and set out focused, data-driven strategies to capitalise on these opportunities and gain a competitive advantage.

Data was sourced from ONS website at following link:
https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/labourdemandvolumesbystandardoccupationclassificationsoc2020uk

Data was then prepared and data model built using MySQL.

Data pipeline was built in MySQL to allow seamless update of most up-to-date data into report.

Report was then built using power BI:
